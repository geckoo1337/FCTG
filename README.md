Four Color Theorem Game

The Four Colour Theorem states that it will take no more than four different colours to colour a map or similar diagram so that no two regions sharing a border are coloured in the same colour. The first statement of the Four Colour Theorem appeared in 1852 but surprisingly it wasnâ€™t until 1976 that it was proved with the aid of a computer. A simpler computer-aided proof was published in 1997 and in 2005, the theorem was proven by mathematician Georges Gonthier with general purpose theorem proving software. On the web, we can find many examples exploiting this simple principle. I made mine using Unity as an engine. It was my first attempt to reach what usually we call a Pixel Game Engine. This project is the root of my C++ template which reproduces the main principle - a texture as a board, dynamically setting each pixel. If you want to know more about what it means, take a look at the link below. Release available on Itch.io ++
